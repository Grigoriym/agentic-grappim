"""Diff every <package>/<class> counter between two Kover XML reports.

Why this exists: a before/after coverage comparison is only valid if nothing outside the
target moved. A non-deterministic class universe (see kover-rank.py's docstring — the report
counts whichever compiler output happens to exist on disk, which an Android/iOS build or a
KSP/annotation-processor re-run changes) means two reports from the same tree can differ by
hundreds of classes with mismatched denominators — reading two dumps by eye in that situation
has produced both a false regression and a false "nothing changed" result. This script answers
"did anything besides what I touched move?" directly instead.

It loads {(name, type): (covered, total)} for every <package> and <class> element in both
reports, then prints — split by element type, because class-universe noise only ever disturbs
`<package>` totals (dropped/added classes leave the key set rather than moving a value; a
`<class>` row that moves is real):

  - the symmetric difference of the key sets (present in one report but not the other)
  - keys present in both whose denominator (covered+missed) differs
  - keys present in both, same denominator, whose covered count differs

A clean run shows "identical" at both levels. A pair straddling different exclude/compilation
states typically shows package-level noise and an empty class-level diff outside your target —
read the class-level list as the actual answer.

Usage:
    ./gradlew koverXmlReport && cp build/reports/kover/report.xml /tmp/before.xml
    # ... make your change ...
    ./gradlew koverXmlReport && cp build/reports/kover/report.xml /tmp/after.xml
    python3 kover-diff.py /tmp/before.xml /tmp/after.xml
